# Health Equity Analysis
Overview
This repository contains a Python project designed to analyze health equity and identify disparities in healthcare access and outcomes across different regions. By leveraging statistical analysis, clustering, and geospatial visualization, this project highlights underserved communities and provides actionable insights for targeted healthcare interventions.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze healthcare data to understand correlations and trends.
Access-to-Care Metrics: Calculate healthcare facilities per capita and disease burden for each region.
Clustering Analysis: Use K-Means clustering to identify underserved regions based on access-to-care metrics and socio-economic indicators.
Geospatial Visualization: Create interactive maps to highlight disparities across regions.
Actionable Insights: Generate reports on underserved regions to inform policy and resource allocation.

Requirements
The following Python libraries are required:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
geopandas
folium
Install them with:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn geopandas folium

How It Works
Data Loading:
Import healthcare-related data with columns such as Population, Healthcare_Facilities, Median_Income, and Disease_Prevalence.

Data Processing:
Calculate metrics like facilities per capita and disease burden.
Standardize data for clustering.

Clustering:
Perform K-Means clustering to group regions based on healthcare equity factors.

Geospatial Analysis:
Map regions using GeoPandas and Folium to visualize clusters.

Insights and Reporting:
Highlight underserved regions and save the results in a CSV file for further analysis.

Example Output
Clustering Visualization
Scatterplots and heatmaps to explore relationships between variables like income and healthcare access.

Interactive Map
Generated an HTML map file (health_equity_map.html) to display regions with healthcare disparities.

Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/FortuneIgboanugo/Health-Equity.git
cd Health-Equity

Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python health_equity_analysis.py

Access results:
Clustering insights are displayed in the terminal.
Interactive maps and CSV files are saved in the repository directory.


Dataset
The project uses synthetic data with the following columns:
Region: Region name.
Population: Population size.
Healthcare_Facilities: Number of healthcare facilities.
Median_Income: Median income of the region.
Disease_Prevalence: Percentage of population with a specific disease.
Uninsured_Rate: Percentage of population without health insurance.
Replace this with real-world data for meaningful analysis.

Results
Clusters Identified: Regions grouped based on access-to-care metrics and socio-economic factors.
Insights Generated: Prioritization of underserved regions for resource allocation.
Reports Saved: Results stored as CSV for easy integration with dashboards.
